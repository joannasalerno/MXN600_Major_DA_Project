# MXN600 major data analysis project: Credit risk model

This repository contains code for a project for MXN600: Advanced Statistical Data Analysis. This project required the team to build a credit risk model from the ground up, to be hypothetically used by a bank to assess loan applications. The goal was to use information known at the time of an application to predict credit risk, and to build a model which improved performance benchmarks relative to a previously provided model on both seen and unseen data. Multiple models were fit and interpreted to subsequently make recommendations to the bank.

This project involved steps such as exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, variable standardisation, variable selection, GLM/GLMM model fitting, and the evaluation of model assumptions, goodness-of-fit, and performance, including predictive performance. This entire process is documented and presented in a RMarkdown report, which has been knitted to both PDF and HTML documents.
